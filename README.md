# Favigen

#### Currently a very early WIP

The goal of this package is to create a favicons/image generation library that is built from the ground up to be used by other libraries.
Currently the go-to library is `favicons` which gives very little control about when or where images are generated, and makes it a nightmare to use in anything but a CLI.
